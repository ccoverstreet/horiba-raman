# Example Rectangular Grid Mapping using AlN and Gd2O3

- Powder particles of stock AlN and Gd2O3 powder were pressed next to each to form a heterogeneous region for Raman mapping
- Using short, 3 second measurements at 10% ND filter with 473 nm wavelength
    - Both samples have fairly strong Raman signal
